# life2vec-light
Basic implementation of the life2vec model with the dummy data. 

This repository contains basic code for the [Using Sequences of Life-events to Predict Human Lives](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-023-00573-5) (life2vec) paper. The [SocialComplexityLab/life2vec](https://github.com/SocialComplexityLab/life2vec) depends (in large) on the specific structure of the data, and the type of hardware.

Here, we provide a code for a simple dummy data and using the latest versions of Python packages, thus, can be easily extended for your specific use.

# life2vec light
Basic implementation of the life2vec model with the dummy data. 

This repository contains basic code for the [Using Sequences of Life-events to Predict Human Lives](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2975478/v1) (life2vec) paper:
1. The [SocialComplexityLab/life2vec](https://github.com/SocialComplexityLab/life2vec) depends (in large) on the specific structure of the data.
2. Here, we provide a code for a simple dummy data -- that can be easily extended for your use.

Code and data is going to be published by the mid-Feb 2024.
